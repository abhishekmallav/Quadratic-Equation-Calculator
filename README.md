# Quadratic-Equation-Calculator

### GUI Quadratic Equation Calculator in Python using Tkinter

required dependencies can be installed by

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Python packages/modules used

- matplot

- math (comes pre-installed with python)

- cmath (comes pre-installed with python)

- tkinter (comes pre-installed with python)

#### Overview of the libraries/packages/modules used

- All the GUI is build using Tkinter library

- Custom determinant and roots module are created to calculate the roots and determinant respectively

- math module is used to calculate the real roots

- cmath module is used to calculate the imaginary roots

- matplot library is used to plot the quadratic graph of the data provided by the user

#### How to use the calculator

1. Enter the Coefficients of xÂ², x and the constant in the respective boxes

2. Press the **Calculate Roots** button

3. The **Determinant** and the **Roots** are shown

4. If you want the graphical representation press the **Graph** button. It creates a interactive graph using matplot and you can also save the graph.

5. If you want to enter another values press the **Clear** button. It will clear the current values and close the current graph window

6. If you want to exit press the **Exit** button or close via the cross in the title bar
